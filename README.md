# Pokémon Crystal Oxide [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a QoL improvement of Pokémon Crystal, based on the disassembly project. The goals are threefold:

 - Remain compatibility with vanilla saves. This includes trading/battling functionality.
 - All Pokemon introduced in Gold and Silver are catchable in Johto. Note that this does not mean that all 251 Pokemon are catchable; thanks to trade compatibility, missing Kanto Pokemon can be traded from Red or Blue.
 - QoL improvements including
   - Running Shoes
   - Reusable TMs
   - No need to teach HMs (Pending item)

## Special Cases

### Heracross
Haracross has been added to the Bug Catching Contest. Though Heracross is technically catchable in Johto, the method of obtaining it is incredibly roundabout. I may revert this in the future.

New rates are:
- Scyther: 4%
- Pinsir: 3%
- Heracross: 3%

### Qwilfish
Qwilfish has been left untouched. Catching Qwilfish requires the Super Rod, which is not available until Kanto--however, the goal is to make all new Pokemon catchable in Johto; it is not to make all Pokemon catchable before Kanto.
